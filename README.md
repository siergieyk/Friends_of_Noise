What have we accomplished?
	We have ..
	- successfully made a firebase connected and authorizing sign in portal
	- matched the styles of the Friends of Noise home website
	- created a sign in area as well as a member area for people to browse their accounts
	- created unique and interesting fields for images and scrolling headlines
    - created a database for collecting member information, a database for events, and a database for tickets and merchandise

What needs to continue to be worked on:
	- Admin privileges needs to be given to certain users and needs to be able to collect data from the database
	- Member page has to be tied into website app
	- Items and tickets need to be added
